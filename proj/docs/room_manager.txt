RoomManager
===========

Role
----
RoomManager tracks membership relationships:
- which room a given fd is in
- which fds are members of a given room

Core Behavior
-------------
- join(fd, room):
  - if fd already in a different room: remove from old room first
  - add fd to new room set
  - update fd -> room mapping
- leave(fd):
  - remove fd from its current room
  - cleanup the room entry if it becomes empty

Invariants
----------
- An fd is in at most one room at a time (as implemented).
- If a room has no members, it is removed from the rooms map (no empty rooms retained).
- members(room) returns a snapshot list suitable for iteration while server sends messages.

Integration Points
------------------
Used by:
- ChatHub for broadcasts and joins/leaves
- EpollServer/Connection lifecycle (cleanup on disconnect)
