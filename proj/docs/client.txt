Client
======

Role
----
The Client provides an interactive terminal chat experience:
- connects to the server over TCP
- encodes commands/messages into framed encrypted protocol messages
- receives frames, verifies + decrypts them, and prints plaintext output

Behavior 
---------------------
1) connect_to(host, port)
2) initialize CryptoContext (shared secret for stage-1)
3) start a receiver loop (often in a thread) that:
   - reads frames (header + payload)
   - decode_message() -> plaintext
   - prints plaintext safely (with minimal I/O races)
4) main input loop:
   - read line from stdin
   - parse command (HELLO/JOIN/DISC or default CHAT)
   - encode_message() and send the frame

Command Parsing 
-------------------------
- HELLO <name>  -> MessageType::Hello
- JOIN <room>   -> MessageType::Join
- DISC or /quit -> MessageType::Disc
- otherwise     -> MessageType::Chat (message text)

Concurrency Notes
-----------------
If the client uses a receiver thread:
- guard stdout writes to avoid interleaving with the prompt.
- a clean shutdown should stop the receiver thread and close the socket to unblock recv().
